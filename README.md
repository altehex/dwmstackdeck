# dwmstackdeck
Two-window layout with one master and a deck of stack windows you can flip through.

TO-DO: add demo gif

## Usage
Press `Mod+S` to enable the layout, you'll see the `M|S` symbol on the bar. Flip the windows as usual with `Mod+J` and `Mod+K`. If no windows in master stack, the windows will be fullscreen as in monocle mode. Only one master window is allowed(but i think i'll change that).

## Installation
```bash
cd <dwm-dir>
git am <path>/dwm-stackdeck-*.diff
```

## Future updates
I plan to add better controls and display opened windows on a panel(it could be the bar with tags, but there might be a problem in case it's occupied with status information)
